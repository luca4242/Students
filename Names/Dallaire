YOUTUBE 

I chose YouTube as my favourite technology because this is something I use everyday and I love. It allows me to watch videos about anything I want which I use to see news and reviews of the newest technology. I also love watching game plays of videogames I like.  You can also subscribe to channels you like and it is free.
